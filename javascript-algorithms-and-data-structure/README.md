## JavaScript:milky_way:
Something I learned by freeCodeCamp:baby:
* `var`, `let` and `const`
There are three way to declare a variable, `var`, `let`, and `const`. 
The `var` can be altered at anytime.
ES6 brings `let`, it is like the `let mut` in `Rust`, you can alter it. 
the `const` in `JavaScript` is somewhat like in `Rust`. The string is **immutable** when declared with `const`,
however, the entries of array are *mutable* and can be changed freely, even if the array was declared with `const`.
